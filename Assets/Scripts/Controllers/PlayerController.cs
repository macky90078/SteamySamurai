/*
 * This class can later be used for controlling the player and otherwise. 
For now, I've decided not to edit the existing PlayerController.cs file.
There is also setup blocked out for player looking, not sure how it will be implemented.

In order to ajust any of the control maps, you will need to edit the 'Rewired Input Manager' prefab or else nothing will sync. Also, the input manager doesn't
transfer from scene to scene, so you'll need to add new prefabs to each scene
